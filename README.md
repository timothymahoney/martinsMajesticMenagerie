## The challenge:  
Please calculate the information listed below from this dataset: https://anapioficeandfire.com/ 


NO knowledge of the fictional universe in question is needed, beyond that provided in the documentation. Indeed, we don't necessarily possess in depth knowledge of this universe. 

The information we want: 
1. All clusters of characters that were born within 5 years of each other 
2. The counts of characters affiliated with each house, who are living in the year 290 AC 

How: 
By any means you see fit, using any stack you see fit. 

Solutions that allow the addition of further and different queries are preferred. 


What to send us: 
1. The code or whatever to automatically calculate the answers to the above 
2. Any instructions necessary to operate your solution 
3. Any assumptions you have made, whether as to the interpretation of the exercise, interpretation of the data, or otherwise. 

You may assume that we will run this on an internet-connected computer. We will be willing to install any common tools, or easily-installed tools necessary to support your solution.
